Basic Model:
    Select some most informative points. Strategies
        1. Select points at random
        2.
    Label them
    Train model on labeled point with notion of uncertainty(for e.g. points near the boundaries) or confidence
    Then label rest of the points with good selection strategy:
        1. Select points near the boundaries, as they have highest chances of altering the model:
            suffers risk of biased selection which in no way relates with the underlying data distribution.
        2.



In active learning there is a risk of superbiased selection which in no way relates with the underlying data distribution.

Three ways of managing sampling bias:
    1. label all the samples
    2. use informatance weighting
    3. explicitly manage sampling regions



Learner models:
    1. Mellow Active Learner:
        H <- set of hypothesis class
        for every unbaled point:
            if there is disagreement between hypothesis class H:
                ask for label y, H <- {h for h in H, h(x) = y}

        return H

    2. Agnostic Active Learner:
